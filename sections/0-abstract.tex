    The goal of the \sunpyproj is to facilitate and promote the use and development of community-led, free, and open source data analysis software for solar physics based on the scientific \python environment.
    The project achieves this goal by developing and maintaining the \sunpypkg core package and supporting an ecosystem of affiliated packages.
    This paper describes the first official stable release (version 1.0) of the core package, as well as the project organization and infrastructure.
    This paper concludes with a discussion of the future of the \sunpyproj.
