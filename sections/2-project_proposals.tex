The organization of the \sunpyproj is modeled on the structure of a board-only not-for-profit corporate entity.
It consists of a self-selected board of up to 10 members.
An executive director, elected by the board, leads the core development team and the development of the \sunpypkg  package and supports the development of affiliated packages.
As such, the executive director is also referred to as the lead developer.
A deputy lead developer, a release manager, a group of subpackage maintainers, as well as other volunteers from the developer community, support the lead developer.
Board members serve two-year terms while the lead developer serves a one-year term.
No positions have term limits.

The \sunpyproj is formally defined through SunPy Enhancement Proposals (SEPs), which are modeled after the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/}}.
All SEPs are version-controlled, citable, and publicly available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP}}.
The first SEP \citep[SEP-0001,][]{sep-0001} defines the scope of an SEP \citep[similar to][]{ape-0001} while the second \citep[SEP-0002,][]{sep-0002} defines the  \sunpyproj organization.

There are three types of SEPs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Standard}: introduces and describes a new feature, or changes to an existing feature to \sunpypkg, and is meant to function as a high-level technical design document.
    \item \textbf{Process}: describes a new process in the organization, or changes to an existing process.
    \item \textbf{Informational}: provides information but does not introduce any new features, changes, or processes.
\end{itemize}

As of the time of writing, there are a total of nine SEPs that have been approved by the board.
Some notable SEPs have led to the formal adoption of physical units \citep[SEP-0003,][see \autoref{sec:units}]{sep-0003} and a specific scientific time class \citep[SEP-0008,][see \autoref{sec:units}]{sep-0008} throughout the code base.
SEPs have also been used to formally define the affiliated-package program \citep[SEP-0004,][see \autoref{sec:affil_package}]{sep-0004} as well as the release schedule and versioning system \citep[SEP-0009,][see \autoref{sec:release}]{sep-0009}.
